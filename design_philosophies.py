#
#                           UNTITLED RPG - DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
#
# This document serves as a guide for the core design principles of this game.
# It is a living document, intended to keep development focused on the key
# features and feelings that make this project unique.
#
# =============================================================================


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# I. CORE WORLD THEME: HARMONY OF CIVILIZATION AND NATURE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The foundational theme of this world is the symbiotic relationship between
# civilization and the natural world. This is not a world of "man vs. nature".
# Instead, cities are built in harmony with forests, magic is drawn from natural
# elements, and societies respect the land they inhabit.
#
# This theme should influence:
# - VISUALS: Cities intertwined with large trees, rivers flowing through towns.
# - LORE: Histories of cooperation between peoples and nature spirits.
# - QUESTS: Problems are more likely to be about restoring balance than about
#   conquering the wilderness.
#
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# II. PLAYER FREEDOM: A SELF-WRITTEN STORY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The player is NOT a "Chosen One" with a predefined destiny. The central goal is
# to provide a sandbox where the player can define their own purpose. The game
# should support multiple, equally valid paths.
#
# Potential Player Paths:
# - The Dungeon Delver: An adventurer focused on exploring ruins and fighting monsters.
# - The Mercenary: A sword-for-hire who takes on contracts for various factions.
# - The Merchant: An entrepreneur focused on crafting, trade, and building an economic empire.
# - The Villain: A character who chooses to act against society for power or other goals.
# - The Guild Master: A leader who recruits NPCs, builds a headquarters, and sends agents on missions.
# - And more.
# The game's systems should be flexible enough to allow for blending these roles.
#
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# III. CHARACTER PROGRESSION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The progression systems are designed to be deliberate and rewarding, encouraging
# thoughtful character development.
#
#   A. STATS PHILOSOPHY (DIABLO 2 INSPIRATION)
#   -----------------------------------------
#   Every single stat point matters. There are no "dump stats." Gains are incremental
#   but noticeable. A character with 20 Strength should feel demonstrably stronger
#   than one with 15.
#
#   - Each stat point should provide a small, clear benefit (e.g., +carry weight,
#     +damage, +crit chance, +mana, +health).
#   - Many abilities, spells, and pieces of equipment will have stat requirements,
#     making investment choices meaningful for build planning.
#
#
#   B. SKILL SYSTEM (ELDER SCROLLS / MUD INSPIRATION)
#   -------------------------------------------------
#   Skills improve through use, not by spending points on a level-up screen.
#
#   - If you use a one-handed sword, your "One-Handed" skill increases.
#   - If you craft potions, your "Alchemy" skill increases.
#   - This system rewards players for *doing* things in the game world, creating
#     a natural and immersive progression path.
#   - Note on skills: Skills don't dictate hitting or missing. Skills will unlock
#       'talents' you can choose from per weapon, or crafting/gathering skill.
# 
#   C. LEVELING AND ENDGAME
#   -----------------------
#   - The planned level cap for the player character is 60.
#   - At later levels, players will have the opportunity to unlock "Prestige Classes."
#     These are advanced specializations of the base classes (e.g., a "Warrior" might
#     prestige into a "Berserker" or a "Guardian"), offering unique and powerful
#     new abilities. Though some prestige classes will be unlockable through deed or 
#     defeating end game 'bosses'
#
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IV. FUTURE SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These are key features planned for later in development.
#
#   A. ECONOMY AND MERCHANTS
#   ------------------------
#   The economy should be more than just static shopkeepers. Future plans include:
#   - A player-driven crafting and gathering system.
#   - Merchants with fluctuating inventories and prices based on region or events.
#   - The ability for the player to open their own shop or establish trade routes.
#
#
#   B. FACTIONS AND REPUTATION
#   --------------------------
#   The player's actions will affect their standing with various factions in the
#   world (e.g., towns, guilds, clans). High reputation may unlock unique quests,
#   items, or followers, while low reputation could lead to hostility.
